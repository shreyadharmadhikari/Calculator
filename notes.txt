Improvements and work pending for Calculator:

1) Decimal numbers handling
2) Divide by Zero Exception handling
3) Operator and expression validity check.
For Example: **, //, ^^, ++ these are not allowed or ******, any these pattern not allowed 
except for:  *-, /-, +-, --, ^-  
4) That is negative numbers and all the possible negative valued cases need to be properly evaluated.
