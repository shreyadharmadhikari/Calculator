# Basic Calculator

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Description

A responsive and user-friendly calculator web application that performs basic mathematical operations.

This project includes custom expression parsing logic with regular expression validation, operator precedence handling, unary minus support, and decimal number support.

The calculator does not use `eval()`. Expressions are parsed and evaluated using custom JavaScript logic.

## Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Power (Exponentiation)
- Decimal number support
